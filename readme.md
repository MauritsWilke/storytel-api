# <img src="./static/logo.svg" height="27px"> Storytel API
An unofficial wrapper for the [Storytel][storytel] API written in TS.\
This project is still in development and I don't recommend using it untill v1 is released. The project isn't on NPM yet, so if you want to use the current version you'll have to clone it.

## ðŸ’¡ How to use
To use storytel-api, first install it from NPM:
```shell
 $ npm i storytel-api
```

Import it and create a client, this does require you to have an [account][signup].

```ts
const Storytel = import "storytel-api";
const client = new Storytel();

const user = await client.signIn("email", "password");
const bookshelf = await user.getBookshelf();
console.log(`Your last book was ${bookshelf[0].title}`);
```
I am still working on documentation but haven't found anything that suits my needs (TypeDoc and I didn't get along). If anyone has suggestions feel free to [contact me][portfolio]!
